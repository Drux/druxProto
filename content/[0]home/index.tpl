<h2>Thanks for your interest in <em>druxProto</em></h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>
    druxProto is a OpenSource prototyping framework that easily lets you create a functional website.
    It does not need to be configured to work with any database and its easy to maintain. Also you can
    re-use a lot of the code when you decide you are satisfied with the with the functionality and design
    should you decide to move forward with your project after the prototype is done.
</p>
<h3>Is it easy to use?</h3>
<p>
    Even with very little knowlegde of PHP you should be able to use this framework since it mostly generate itself.
    All you need to know is some basic HTML and CSS to get your design the way you want it and you are set. Should you
    require more sections and functionality then what druxProto provides, some PHP knowlegde wont hurt.
</p>
<h3>What do I need to get started?</h3>
<p>
    The only thing you need is a Apache server running PHP where you can upload your files. This can also be set up locally
    by using programs like LAMP (linux), MAMP (OSX), WAMP (Windows) or XAMPP (Universal).

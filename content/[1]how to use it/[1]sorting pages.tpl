<h2>Sorting pages</h2>
<p>
    By default pages will be sorted according to the name of the file. If you wish though you can add brackets with
    a number inside them to set the priority. The lowest number will be the page that appear first in the navigation.
    <br />Example for files/subpages: <em>[0]filename.tpl</em>
    <br />Example for folders/mainpages: <em>[3]home</em>

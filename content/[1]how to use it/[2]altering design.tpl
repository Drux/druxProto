<h2>Altering design</h2>
<p>
    The main design is based upon the files in the templates and css folders. The main layout for the site should
    be in templates/layout/main.tpl. The template engine (found in the libs folder) and index site will insert the
    markup from the other files (footer.tpl, header.tpl, nav.tpl and sidebar.tpl) to the proper sections in the
    main layout.
